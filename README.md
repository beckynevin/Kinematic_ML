# Kinematic_ML
This repository is a trial run of running various ML algorithms on MaNGA kinematic maps.

It will focus on clustering analysis for an unsupervised look at stellar velocity map data.

This includes:
1) k-means clustering
2) Various pre-processing algorithms for k-means (t-SNE)
3) Gaussian 
4) Hierarchical clustering
